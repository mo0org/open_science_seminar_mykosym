# *about the project...*

this repo was created for the purpose of a seminar entitled **how to make open science** lead at the Mycorrhizal Symbioses Department at the Botanical Institute of the Czech Academy of Science, the 18th of February 2026.

the aim of the repo is to provide explanations and a "manual" how to use GitHub, Git and RStudio, provide reusable lines of code to use in RStudio and create a space for further questions/answers and additional tips and tricks that have not been mentioned in the seminar.
